# RetroSockets
###_You've got feels. We've got websockets_

### OVERVIEW
This is a rebuild of my former retrosockets app with React. I was previously using only jQuery and Socket.io. It worked fine, but was hard to maintain / improve because nothing was well organized. React solved a lot of those problems for me.

### PURPOSE
Retrosockets is a proof of concept retrospective tool for remote or dispersed teams. 

### DEMO
https://retrosockets.herokuapp.com/

### UP & RUNNING
* clone the repo
* `npm install` (_should also run the postinstall script by default_)
* `node server.js`
* open your browser to 'http://localhost:8080/'

**This app also works on your phone and other devices. To use with multiple devices locally:**
* find your local IP (_On a Mac it's under System Preferences/Network just under the status line._)
